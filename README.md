# 🧠 Artificial intelligence: Apple Intelligence and the future of testing

> **"Unbelievably thin. Incredibly powerful."**  
> **"Built for Apple Intelligence"**  
> **"Sky high performance with M4."**

This project is dedicated to **artificial intelligence (AI)** and its application in **QA testing, automation, and user experience**. We were inspired by Apple's style — minimalist, precise, and user-oriented.
